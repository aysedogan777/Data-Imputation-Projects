# Data-Imputation-Projects
k-NN, MissForest imputations and GAIN algorithms are used.
Aim: Comparing imputation methods to find which one is giving better outcomes. 
Result: In 3 inputs they gave the similar outcomes but in one of the imputation model GAIN imputation gave higher AUC Score in the classification application.

Going on: Time spatial data will be used to get better imputations.
